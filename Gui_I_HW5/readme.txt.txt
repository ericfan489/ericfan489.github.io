GUI 1 HW 5 Scrabble
For this assigment I was tasked with programming a scrabble game. I got the game to randomly select tiles from the given array and display them to the screen on top of the tile holder.
The tiles are also draggable and when they are not dropped on the tile holder or the scrabble board then they are returned to where they were before. I have a restart game button that restarts the game.
I implemented some droppable objects on the scrabble board so that the tiles can be formatted nicely.
