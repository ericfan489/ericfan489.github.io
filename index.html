        <p class="middle">I am Eric Fan, and I am a student at UMass Lowell studying computer science. I am set to graduate in Spring 2022, and I am currently looking for a full-time job in software engineering or Information Technology.
        I have been working as a grader and tutor for the past two semesters for Calculus 1-3 and Computing 3. This semester I am working for UMass Lowell Tech services as a student support analyst. Below is a table of my relevent coursework organized by the semester that I took them.

We stayed around the area for a week in a couple different hotels. I hiked 10 miles down a trail with my brother and it took over 2 hours to go down and back up. That was the second day of staying there and it was also the hottest. I got sunburnt that day and continued to get burnt for the next couple days. We also visited Monument Valley which is shown in the picture on the left. Super exciting to see these natural wonders up close. Overall very enjoyable trip and would recommend to anyone.</p>
